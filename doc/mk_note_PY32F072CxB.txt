Can bus serial

PB8 -- RX
PB9 -- TX

Khi kết nối với TJA1050 thì phải qua chuyển mức do TJA1050 dùng logic 5V

PY - Notes

Example execution steps:
1.Compile and download the program;
2.Connect the PC to the STK board through the USB to TTL module, and the
connection method between the STK board and the USB to TTL module is as follows:
STK board   USB to TTL module
PA02(TX)  -->  RX
PA03(RX)  -->  TX
GND       -->  GND
3.Connect the PC, CAN adapter board, and STK board through the USB to CAN module,
and the connection method is as follows:
STK board           CAN adapter board
PB8(CAN_RX)    -->    R21  
PB9(CAN_TX)    -->    R20
GND            -->    GND

CAN adapter board     USB to CAN module
CAN-H           -->    CAN-H
CAN-L           -->    CAN-L
4.Open PCAN-View and configure the connection method for PCAN-View as CAN2.0,
Clock Frequency: 24MHz, Nominal Bit Rate: 250kBit/s, Data Bit Rate: not set,
Extended
5.Reset the STK board and observe if PCAN-View has received 8-byte data data
0x1~0x8. PCAN-View receiving indicates that the STK board has successfully sent
data, otherwise it indicates that the STK board has failed to send data;
6.After receiving the data, PCAN View manually sends an 8-byte data with ID
0x1234567F through PCAN View. Observe whether the serial port prints the data
sent by PCAN View. If the serial port prints, it indicates that the STK board
has successfully received the data, otherwise the STK board has failed to receive
the data.
